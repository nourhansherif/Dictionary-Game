# Dictionary-Game
A word learning Game gives the user the meaning of the word and lets him guess the word. 
The user has 3 trials to guess, if failed the game will show random letters of a word and let him try to complete the word. 
The game does the following: 
  - Store a suitable number of words with their meaning (at least 100) divided into different categories (ex. countries, movies...etc). 
  - Upload All words in the Same Suitable Data Structure.  
  - Let the user choose a Category and then select a random word and show its meaning to start the game. 
  - Let the user has 3 guesses: 
    - If he guesses right, he wins and the game moves to the next word. 
    - If he fails in the 3 trials, the game show few letters of the word and let the user guess the remaining letters as the hangman game given 3 more chances. 
    - If he fails the last 3 chances, he loses the game.  
 
 The project is console-based and is written in C++ Programming Language.
